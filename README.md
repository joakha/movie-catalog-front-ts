Typescript version of public frontend for my personal backend project

Project deployed on github pages:

https://joakha.github.io/movie-catalog-front-ts/

Allows the user to view, sort and search movie, director and review data.

Data comes from my spring boot project rest api on render.com: https://movie-catalog-66r6.onrender.com

Since the spring boot project is hosted on render it's slow and waking up takes a minute or so.

Originally made with JS + React but I converted this to TypeScript for self learning purposes.
